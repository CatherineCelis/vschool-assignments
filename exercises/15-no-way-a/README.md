we needed to define the variable gator globally in order to use it outside of the function block. Created a function named removeA and plugged the string aligator into the function at the end. replace is a built in method that will replace all of the instances of a inside og our string that we created, then the g stands for globally, and the i stands for insensitive to case(upper or lower), then we replaced it with nothing hence the set of empty string""

then we call our removeA function and plug in our string var name gator.
