This assignment was to define a variable and assign it a function and then to use it by printing "Hello Class" to the terminal. To pull up the terminal I use the tilda key and the control button together. Then to print to the terminal I input:  node app.js into the terminal and pressed enter.Nothing will happen unless you make sure to call that function after the curly braces which holds the function definition chosen.3/4/18 @ 12:53 am.
