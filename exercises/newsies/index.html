            <div class="art1">
                <p><strong style="font-size:50px;font-family:cursive;">Elephant </strong> bones were found inside of a volcano near the 
                Southfield Village Bayou early last Friday night. 
                Discovered by a man around 11:00 pm! Local of the village,
                Indiana Jones was taking his pet racoon "Ricky" for a 
                walk when he abruptly tripped over a pile of something 
                sharp protrudding out of the wet soil of the banks.
                Jones let out a loud cry of agony. The surprisingly 
                sharp tusks of the elephant were still sharp as ever. 
                Luckily Jones cry was heared by a hiker not far from 
                the site and he was rescued and takin straight to the 
                St. Marys Hospital to recover, along with his pet for 
                company.</p>

                <p><strong style="font-size: 50px;font-family: cursive;">The bones </strong> were bleached white with time, 
                which is usually an affect of being left to the 
                elements. This has been the 5th discovery of elephant 
                remains found in the past month. There is no record of 
                phants living in the wild here on this continent. 
                Suspected poaching is being investigated by the Elephant 
                Lover's of North America. The authorities have also been 
                searching for possible elephant skin sales across the 
                black market to help point to any possible suspects. 
                If anyone has any information on where these elephant 
                remains might have come from please contact the E.L.N.A.</p>
