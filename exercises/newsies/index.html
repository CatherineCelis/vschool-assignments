    <div class="articlecontent">
        <p>Elephant bones found inside of a volcano near the Southfield Village Bayou early last Friday night. Discovered by a man around 11:00 pm! Local of the village, Indiana Jones was taking his pet racoon "Ricky" for a walk when he abruptly tripped over a pile of something sharp protrudding out of the wet soil of the banks. Jones let out a loud cry of agony. The surprisingly sharp tusks of the elephant were still sharp as ever. Luckily Jones cry was heared by a hiker not far from the site and he was rescued and takin straight to the St. Marys Hospital to recover, along with his pet for company.</p>

        <p> The bones were bleached white with time, which is usually an affect of being left to the elements. This has been the 5th discovery of elephant remains found in the past month. There is no record of elephants living in the wild here on this continent. Suspected poaching is being investigated by the Elephant Lover's of North America. The authorities have also been searching for possible elephant skin sales across the black market to help point to any possible suspects. If anyone has any information on where these elephant remains might have come from please contact the E.L.N.A.</p>
