                    <strong>*Lucid Dreams*</strong> are very common following a traumatic event. Whether they picture the traumatic event directly, or involve other images and themes, or both, they probably reflect a normal healing process, and will diminish in frequency and intensity if recovery is progressing. If after several weeks no change is noted, consultation with a therapist is advisable.What a wonderful day it is today tra la la. I need to make this paragraph to be the length of the picture on it's left. Perhaps it will make it a lot easier on the eyes and not as blocky. Hopefully it is alright that I am just typing in random nonsense to fill in the blanks. Almost there and then we can get back to dreaming all day long. Every day all day. I am ready to take a nice lonnng nap so I can dream.</p>

                <p>
                        Nightly, I write my ticket
                        deciding where to go
                        whom to see</br>
                        
                        travelling through the many worlds</br>
                        calling to me others and shouting</br>
                        “Wake up! Do not lose this chance to be free!”</br>
                        why forsake the magic carpet?</br>
                        why deny yourself the honest dream?</br>
                        
                        to fly, to dive the depths and know the highest peak</br>
                        to walk through walls and conjure objects, people
                        do not slumber, do not fail</br>
                        
                        it is a brave soul who wanders the night’s terrain</br>
                        who dares to break the bonds of physics</br>
                        
                        and if you venture forth
                        and when you’ve won your battle with fear</br>
                        and when you’ve learned to make the dream</br>
                        why then break the dream
                        arrive at the clear light of seeing</br>
                        
                        be a drop of the infinite
                        so when death comes</br>
                        it will be no stranger
                        for you’ve danced in her doorway before</br>
