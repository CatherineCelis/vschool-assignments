            <h2>Our Perfect Dream World</h2>
            <p>My “utopia”, my perfect place, my “dream world” would be something not too way over the top like flying spaceships, or robots bringing me drinks. It would be a very quiet, calm, and peaceful place where I can actually hear my thoughts, and individuals are all treated fairly, and everyone isn’t afraid of sharing their opinions about life or society without getting bad looks from others. I’m not saying I’d be living in a cube or anything like that. Of course the water would be always deep blue, the weather would be not too hot but occasionally cool, the skies would always have puffy clouds and bright blue skies, and the stars would shine the most brightest at night. My “utopia” would be a place where it would be safe to walk outside in the middle of the night without having to think about something dangerous happening to you. A place where you can go to a park and hang out for several hours without having to think about a hundred different things that run through your head constantly.</p>
